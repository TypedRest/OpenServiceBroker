Methods BindAsync(ServiceBindingRequest) Generates the Service Binding. public Task<ServiceBinding> BindAsync(ServiceBindingRequest request) Parameters request ServiceBindingRequest Parameters for the requested Service Binding. Returns Task<ServiceBinding> The binding. Exceptions ConflictException A binding with the same id already exists but with different attributes. UnbindAsync(string, string) Unbinds/deletes the Service Binding. public Task UnbindAsync(string serviceId, string planId) Parameters serviceId string The id of the service associated with the binding being deleted. planId string The id of the plan associated with the binding being deleted. Returns Task Exceptions GoneException The binding does not exist (anymore)."

    "summary": "Open Service Broker API for .NET This project provides both a server and a client .NET library for the Open Service Broker API specification. This specification allows developers, ISVs, and SaaS vendors a single, simple, and elegant way to deliver services to applications running within cloud native platforms such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. The Server Library implements the API for you using ASP.NET Core. You simply need to provide implementations for a few interfaces, shielded from the HTTP-related details. The Client Library allows you to call Service Brokers that implement the API using idiomatic C# interfaces and type-safe DTOs. Server Library Set up a regular ASP.NET Core 8.0+ project and add the NuGet package OpenServiceBroker.Server. Then implement the following interfaces: ICatalogService (optionally also IETagProvider and/or ILastModifiedProvider on the same class) either IServiceInstanceBlocking or IServiceInstanceDeferred or both either IServiceBindingBlocking or IServiceBindingDeferred or both Register your implementations in the IServiceCollection for dependency injection. For example: services.AddTransient<ICatalogService, MyCatalogService>() .AddTransient<IServiceInstanceBlocking, MyServiceInstanceBlocking>() .AddTransient<IServiceBindingBlocking, MyServiceBindingBlocking>(); Then enable MVC Controllers using .AddMvc() or .AddControllers() followed by calling the .AddOpenServiceBroker() extension method: services.AddControllers() .AddOpenServiceBroker(); You can use the project template to quickly set up a pre-configured ASP.NET Core 8.0 project with OpenServiceBroker.Server. Versioning The Server Library inspects the X-Broker-API-Version header for all requests (as defined in the specification). Currently it accepts all versions from 2.0 to 2.16. Client Library Add the NuGet package OpenServiceBroker.Client to your project. You can then create an instance of the client like this: var client = new OpenServiceBrokerClient(new Uri(\"http://example.com/\")); Asynchronous Operations All operations that result in HTTP request are async. Non-successful HTTP status codes are mapped to domain-specific exception types (BrokerException and derived). Refer to the libraries XML documentation for details on which exceptions to expect on which invocations. The Open Service Broker API specification allows for both synchronous/blocking and asynchronous/incomplete/deferred operations. To avoid confusion with the C# language concept of async this library uses the terms \"blocking\" and \"deferred\" to describe these API features. Instances of OpenServiceBrokerClient have three properties that expose the same functionality in different ways: ServiceInstancesBlocking allows you to request blocking responses from the server. However, you may encounter AsyncRequiredException if the server does not support blocking operations. ServiceInstancesDeferred allows you to request deferred responses from the server. However, you have to manually handle waiting/polling for the completion of operations. ServiceInstancesPolling combines the advantages of both. It requests deferred responses from the server and transparently handles the waiting/polling for you. It is the recommended option for most use-cases. Samples Read the catalog: var result = await client.Catalog.ReadAsync(); Provision a service instance: var result = await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].ProvisionAsync(new ServiceInstanceProvisionRequest { ServiceId = \"abc\", PlanId = \"xyz\", Context = new JObject { {\"platform\", \"myplatform\"} }, Parameters = new JObject { {\"some_option\", \"some value\"} } }); Fetch a service instance: var result = await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].FetchAsync(); Update a service instance: var result = await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].UpdateAsync(new ServiceInstanceUpdateRequest { ServiceId = \"abc\", PlanId = \"xyz\", Context = new JObject { {\"platform\", \"myplatform\"} }, Parameters = new JObject { {\"some_option\", \"some value\"} } }); Deprovision a service instance: await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].DeprovisionAsync(serviceId: \"abc\", planId: \"xyz\"); Create a service binding: var result = await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].ServiceBindings[\"456\"].ProvisionAsync(new ServiceBindingRequest { ServiceId = \"abc\", PlanId = \"xyz\", BindResource = new ServiceBindingResourceObject { AppGuid = \"e490c9df-6627-4699-8db8-55edc2a88e58\" }, Context = new JObject { {\"platform\", \"myplatform\"} }, Parameters = new JObject { {\"some_option\", \"some value\"} } }); Fetch a service binding: var result = await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].ServiceBindings[\"456\"].FetchAsync(); Delete a service binding: await client.ServiceInstancesPolling[\"123\"].ServiceBindings[\"456\"].UnbindAsync(serviceId: \"abc\", planId: \"xyz\"); Versioning The Client Library specifies the API version it expects by setting the X-Broker-API-Version header for all requests (as defined in the specification). Currently the Client Library supports the 2.16 feature set but defaults to setting the version header to 2.13 for greater compatibility with older brokers. If the broker you are calling expects a different version and you are sure your request is compliant with that version of the specification you can override this: client.SetApiVersion(new ApiVersion(2, 16));"
